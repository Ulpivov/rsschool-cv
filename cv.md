The main goal is to become a JavaScript programmer.The priorities are deep studying JavaScript and English. My strengths are responsible, hartworker, reliable, honest, self-taught, persevering in achieving their goals.
I am a good team player. I don't have much experience. I have a little practice in website layout. I like to decide difficult tasks, if I don't know the answer I try to find it in different sources.
